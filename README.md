# The Dynamo Language
Dynamo is a functional systems programming language, aimed to provide high-level abstractions through the use of functional programming while retaining low-level control through the use of the dependently typed Graded Modal Type Theory. Dynamo is made with the purpose of researching formally verified low-level software, and as such at its current state is not fit for production use. If you would like to help contibute to the repository, major checklists and plans are located in the [issues tab](https://github.com/AlexFischbacher/dynamo/issues).

## Design Principles
 - **Begin to define a specification for the langauge immediately.** This makes it crystal clear as to how the language is to be built. Before any work on a compiler is made, the specification needs to end up in a stable position, do allow as little deviation from the plan as possible.
 - More will be added as time continues. Nothing is really final yet, and that is because I really want to make sure I do things right, for both systems programmers that are likely coming from C *and* functional programmers that come from a language like ML or Haskell.

*(You do not need to read below if you are simply interested in the language. What follows is a more personal message to myself and others reading.)*

## Fears and Personal Notes
I feel like it is necessary to include this section for myself to go over what will likely cause me to start considering abandoning the project. I continually fail to achieve the ideas I am so passionate about, and I just cannot sit back and go through that hell again for yet another potential accomplishment. These fears and notes are likely irrational in nature, and I will never doubt that. However, this section is here to hold myself accountable for my inactivity and considerations of dropping the project before I even start.

- I'm extremely overwhelmed at the thought of implementing a project of this scale. It is a lot of learning to conceptualize and implement a language; I *really* don't want to screw up along the way (which could just be perfectionism speaking, honestly). Hopefully, the idea of the language specification will give me a sandbox to experiment and get feedback before finalization of the details happens. 
- Project management and planning is my weakest aspect. I hope to improve this with this project, but using that as an excuse to give up is completely invalid.
- It is very likely that this language will fail to appeal to both target audiences. The unfortunate truth is that the two target audiences are so split on langauge design principles that this language likely wont stick with people. While it is unfortunate if this does end up being the case, this isn't a prime worry of mine considering the things I will eventually learn along the way.

Make no mistake, this project is very personal to me. Improvement of both the self and the world are the goals.

Thank you. :heart:
